## Project Overview

TurboIndex is a **globally-installable npm package** that provides a local codebase vector search MCP server.

**Core idea:** `npm install -g turboindex` → an AI assistant can index and semantically search your codebase, fully local, no cloud.

## Critical Gotchas (Read Before Writing Code)

### 1. Turbovec `load()` is a classmethod ⚠️

This is the **most important bug** to avoid:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT — returns a working index
index = IdMapIndex.load("index.tvim")

# ❌ WRONG — produces broken index (search returns empty, contains returns False)
index = IdMapIndex(dim=384, bit_width=4)
index.load("index.tvim")
```

### 2. Server has 3 threads

```
Main thread:  FastMCP event loop (handles MCP JSON-RPC over stdio)
Worker thread: Background indexer (daemon, processes 5-file batches)
Watchdog:      Idle shutdown timer (daemon, exits after 30 inactive minutes)
```

### 3. Lazy loading pattern

Model, index, and heavy imports are **not loaded at startup**. Load on first use:

```python
model = None          # Set on first ensure_model()
index = None          # Set on first ensure_index()
meta = {}             # Loaded at startup (small JSON)
store = {}            # Loaded at startup (small JSON)
```

- `fastembed` is **imported inside `ensure_model()`**, not at module level — this keeps cold startup under 0.5s instead of ~10s.
- `get_index_stats()` and `turboindex://status`/`turboindex://stats` must **never** trigger a model or index load
- Only `search_codebase()` and `index_directory()` call `ensure_resources()`

### 4. Thread safety — Two independent locks (never nest)

```python
queue_lock = threading.Lock()   # Protects only index_queue deque
index_lock = threading.Lock()   # Protects index, store, meta
```

**Golden rule:** Never hold both locks at once. I/O and `model.encode()` are done without any lock.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT
content = read_file(path)              # No lock
vec = model.encode([content])          # No lock
with index_lock:                       # Only critical section
    index.add_with_ids(vec, ids)
    store[id] = {...}
```

### 5. Idle shutdown

```python
IDLE_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60   # 30 minutes
os._exit(0)              # Hard exit (not sys.exit, which hangs on threads)
```

Every tool and resource handler must call `touch()` to reset the timer.

### 6. Atomic writes

All three persistence files (`index.tvim`, `meta.json`, `store.json`) must be written atomically using temp-file + `os.replace()`. A crash during a direct write corrupts the file.

```python
index.write(INDEX_PATH + ".tmp")
os.replace(INDEX_PATH + ".tmp", INDEX_PATH)  # Atomic
```

### 7. Cold-start consistency check

On startup, `len(meta)` must equal `len(store)`. If they disagree (crash between writes), rebuild `meta` from `store`. Store is the source of truth because it has the path for every vector.

### 8. Stale re-indexing uses random sampling

Do NOT sort all 10,000 files by `last_indexed` on every idle check. Use `random.sample()` on the filtered candidates.

### 9. `_stop_event` for clean thread shutdown

Background threads (`background_worker`, `idle_watchdog`) check `_stop_event.is_set()` in their loop condition. Tests set this event between runs to prevent thread pollution:

```python
server._stop_event.set()  # Signal threads to stop
```

Tests that need background threads must clear it before starting them:
```python
server._stop_event.clear()
t = threading.Thread(target=server.background_worker, daemon=True)
t.start()
```

### 10. FastMCP 3.x uses newline-delimited JSON transport

The MCP stdio transport in FastMCP 3.x sends/receives one JSON-RPC message per line (`\n`-delimited). The `Content-Length` header protocol from earlier MCP specs is NOT used:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT — newline-delimited
pipe.write(json.dumps(msg) + "\n")
resp = json.loads(pipe.readline().strip())

# ❌ WRONG — this is the old MCP stdio protocol (not supported by FastMCP 3.x)
pipe.write(f"Content-Length: {len(body)}\r\n\r\n{body}")
```

### 11. None-guards on internal handlers

`handle_index()` and `handle_remove()` are called from the background worker without `ensure_resources()`. They must guard against `None` model/index:

```python
def handle_remove(file_path: str) -> None:
    if index is None:
        return   # Can't remove from disk if index isn't loaded

def handle_index(file_path: str) -> None:
    if model is None or index is None:
        return   # Can't embed or store
```

### 12. Signal handler uses non-blocking lock

The signal handler calls `persist_all()` which acquires `index_lock`. If a signal arrives while `background_worker` holds `index_lock` during its own `persist_all()`, the handler would deadlock. Use `blocking=False`:

```python
if index_lock.acquire(blocking=False):
    try:
        persist_all()
    finally:
        index_lock.release()
```

### 13. Removed-files detection holds lock during `os.path.exists`

The `index_directory` tool's removed-files detection must hold `index_lock` during `os.path.exists` to prevent TOCTOU races where meta is modified by a concurrent call:

```python
with index_lock:
    removed_files = [
        p for p in list(meta.keys())
        if p.startswith(directory_path) and not os.path.exists(p)
    ]
```

## MCP Contract

### Tools

| Function | Signature | Loads Model? |
|---|---|---|
| `index_directory` | `(path: str) → str` | Yes (lazy) |
| `search_codebase` | `(query: str, k: int = 3) → str` | Yes (lazy) |
| `get_index_stats` | `() → str` | **No** |

### Resources

| URI | Returns | Loads Model? |
|---|---|---|
| `turboindex://status` | Human-readable status | **No** |
| `turboindex://stats` | JSON document | **No** |

---

## Design Constraints

1. **`index_directory` must return instantly** — no blocking on embedding. Enqueue to background worker and return status.
2. **Persistence after every batch** — `index.write()`, save `meta.json`, save `store.json` after each background batch.
3. **Incremental indexing** — detect new/changed/removed files by comparing against `meta.json`. Skip unchanged files.
4. **Stale re-indexing** — when queue is empty, find files with `last_indexed > 7 days` and queue them with low priority.
5. **Supported file types** — `.py`, `.rs`, `.md`, `.txt`. Extendable via a constant list.
6. **Content truncation** — files are capped at 2000 characters per chunk (simple v1 strategy).
7. **Node wrapper** — `bin/cli.js` must resolve paths relative to `__dirname`, not `process.cwd()`.

---

## Running & Testing

```bash
# Test the Python server directly (FastMCP inspector)
cd src
fastmcp dev server.py

# Test the full npm pipeline
npm link                          # Simulates global install
turboindex                     # Should launch the server
```

The server communicates over **stdio** using JSON-RPC 2.0. The FastMCP framework handles all protocol details — you just register tools and resources with decorators.

## Porting from Docs

The implementation plan is documented across these files (read them in order):

1. `docs/architecture.md` — System design, decisions, threading model
2. `docs/usage.md` — Exact tool contracts, parameters, return formats
3. `docs/reference.md` — Code patterns, turbovec API, error handling
4. `docs/roadmap.md` — What to build and in what order

The current **priority** is Phase 1 (scaffolding) followed by Phase 2 (server implementation).

## Maintain the Journal

After each session of work, log a brief entry in `JOURNAL.md` using the template at the bottom. Cover:

- **What happened** — files created/modified, decisions made
- **Key discoveries** — bugs found, API surprises, performance observations
- **Decisions made** — rationale for design choices
- **Open questions** — anything unresolved for next time

This keeps a permanent record for future agents and human contributors.
