## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-26

### Changed

- **Removed postinstall script** — venv setup now runs automatically on first `turboindex` run instead of at install time. No more `allow-scripts` warning. Users just run `npm install -g turboindex` and that's it.
- **CLI auto-setup on first run** — when `.venv` is missing, `bin/cli.js` runs `scripts/setup.js` inline with all output redirected to stderr (keeps stdout clean for MCP protocol).
- **README simplified** — back to single `npm install -g turboindex` command.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-26

### Changed

- **Updated project description** — new punchier tagline across GitHub, npm, and README: "Fully local semantic code search for your AI assistant. Powered by Google TurboQuant vector quantization and jina-v2-base-code embeddings."
- **README intro rewritten** to match the new description style.

### Added

- **Community health files:** CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.0), SECURITY.md (GitHub private vulnerability reporting), SUPPORT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates (bug report + feature request), pull request template.
- **GitHub Discussions enabled.**
- **Community profile at 100%.**

### Fixed

- **Runtime tests** — 14 tests updated for redesigned setup.js API (log/error format, execSync injection, checkFn).
- **Prepublish MCP smoke test** — added missing `--stdio` flag.
- **JS test paths** — explicit file paths for Windows compatibility.
- **Integration test encoding** — UTF-8 with error replacement for cross-platform robustness.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Project scaffolding:** `package.json` with `bin` and `postinstall`, `scripts/setup.js`, `bin/cli.js`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`
- **Python MCP server** (`src/server.py`) with FastMCP + Turbovec
- **Disk-persistent index** (`~/.turboindex/index.tvim`, `meta.json`, `store.json`) with atomic writes
- **Background indexing worker** — daemon thread, 5-file batches, 1s interval
- **Incremental indexing** — skip unchanged files via mtime comparison
- **Stale file re-indexing** — idle worker refreshes files older than 7 days
- **Lazy loading** — model, index, and embedding model import all load on first use only (instant startup, no cold imports)
- **Idle shutdown watchdog** — exits after 30 minutes of inactivity; client auto-restarts
- **Signal handling** — SIGINT/SIGTERM persist state before exit
- **Three MCP tools:** `index_directory`, `search_codebase`, `get_index_stats`
- **Two MCP resources:** `turboindex://status`, `turboindex://stats`
- **CLI flags:** `--help`, `--version`, `--debug`
- **Startup validation:** Python >= 3.9 check, required package imports
- **Full documentation suite:** getting-started, usage, architecture, reference, roadmap
- `AGENTS.md` — orientation for AI coding agents
- `CHANGELOG.md` — version history
- `JOURNAL.md` — development journal

### Fixed

- **`deque.sort()` bug in `dequeue_batch`** — `collections.deque` has no `.sort()` method. Converted to list for sorting, then rebuilt deque with remaining items.
- **Moved `import random` to module level** — was imported inside `find_stale_files` on every call.
- **Moved `import signal` to module level** — was imported inside `main()` on every invocation.
- **Added None-guard in `persist_all`** — silently returns if index hasn't been loaded yet, preventing `AttributeError`.
- **Wrapped `persist_all` in try/except in background worker** — a disk failure no longer kills the worker thread; error is logged and counter incremented.
- **Worker now tracks `processed` count** — `worker_state["processed"]` was never incremented. Each successfully processed file now increments it.
- **Worker sets `worker_state["status"]`** — switches between `"idle"` and `"indexing"` as the queue drains/fills.
- **Lazy import of embedding model** — moved from module-level to inside `ensure_model()`, reducing cold startup from ~10s to <0.5s.
- **Integration test transport** — FastMCP 3.x uses newline-delimited JSON, not `Content-Length` headers. Fixed `_send`/`_recv` accordingly.
- **Test performance** — added `mock_model`/`mock_index` fixtures to 7 `index_directory` tests that were loading the real embedding model, cutting unit test time from 54s to 6.8s.
- **None-guards in `handle_index` and `handle_remove`** — return early if `model` or `index` is None, preventing AttributeError crashes when called without `ensure_resources()`.
- **`os.walk` PermissionError guard** — `index_directory` now catches `PermissionError` and returns a descriptive error instead of crashing.
- **`search_codebase` empty query guard** — returns `"Error: Query cannot be empty."` for empty/whitespace-only input.
- **`index_stats` `default=str`** — added `default=str` to `json.dumps()` to handle non-serializable `last_error` values without `TypeError`.
- **Case-insensitive file extension matching** — `index_directory` now uses `.lower()` on filenames so `.PY`, `.Py`, `.TXT` etc. are detected.
- **TOCTOU race in `removed_files` detection** — moved `os.path.exists` check inside `index_lock` to close the race window.
- **`idle_watchdog` persist failure safety** — wrapped `persist_all()` in try/except so the watchdog still shuts down cleanly even if persist fails.
- **Signal handler deadlock fix** — signal handler now uses `index_lock.acquire(blocking=False)` to avoid deadlock when `background_worker` holds the lock during `persist_all`.
- **`_stop_event` for clean thread shutdown** — added `threading.Event` to signal `background_worker` and `idle_watchdog` loops to exit, enabling test isolation.
- **`clean_globals` fixture now stops background threads** — sets `_stop_event` at the start of every test, preventing thread pollution across tests.
- **Worker tests clear stop event** — all tests that start `background_worker` threads now call `_stop_event.clear()` to let them run.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Extended `index_directory` file types** — now scans `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.toml`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml` in addition to the original `.py`, `.rs`, `.md`, `.txt`. All extensions unified in a single `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` constant.
- **`.gitignore` support in `index_directory`** — new `respect_gitignore` parameter (default `True`) skips files matched by `.gitignore` rules found in the directory tree.
- **`_persist_locked` triple-failure guard** — when all three persistence targets (index, meta, store) fail, raises `RuntimeError("All persistence targets failed")` so callers can detect catastrophic disk failures.
- **Cross-platform `_sync_file` helper** — fsyncs the index temp file before renaming; handles Windows (write-append mode required for fsync) vs POSIX correctly.
- **`TestPersistLockedAllThreeFail` test class** — 3 tests verifying the triple-failure RuntimeError is raised, partial failure doesn't raise, and the worker correctly records the error.
- **Docs: `usage.md` fully rewritten** — documents all 7 tools (`index_directory`, `search_codebase`, `keyword_search`, `update_file_index`, `get_index_stats`, `drop_index`, `read_file_content`), `.gitignore` support, supported file types table, latency table, and workflows.
- **Docs: `roadmap.md` updated** — all Phase 1–7 checkboxes marked complete with ✅ indicators.
- **`TestDequeueBatchBenchmark` test class** — 5 tests verifying correctness and performance with 2000-item queues: drain correctness, no duplicates/loss, same-path multiple priorities, O(n) scaling check (ratio < 5x for 1000→2000 items), and empty-queue speed.
- **`TestIdleWatchdogTripleFailure` test** — verifies idle watchdog logs a warning and still calls `os._exit(0)` when `persist_all` raises the new triple-failure RuntimeError.

### Changed

- **Tool deduplication** — merged `index_workspace` → `index_directory`, `semantic_search` → `search_codebase`, `get_index_status` → `get_index_stats`. Old tools kept as backward-compatible `@mcp.tool` wrappers marked `[Deprecated]`.
- **`SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` constant** — single tuple used by `index_directory` and `auto_index_on_startup` instead of separate extension lists.
- **`_persist_locked` refactored** — tracks errors per target individually; meta/store persist continues even if index write fails. Only raises when ALL three fail.
- **`dequeue_batch` optimized** — switched from full `list.sort()` (O(n log n)) to `heapq.nsmallest` with index-based selection (O(n log k), where k = BATCH_SIZE = 5). Correctly handles duplicate queue entries via index-based deduplication. Short-circuits to full sort when draining the entire queue.

### Fixed

- **`current_id` race in `handle_index`** — `global current_id` declaration moved inside `with index_lock` block. Previously read outside the lock, which was race-safe only by accident (single worker thread).
- **Flaky concurrency test** — `test_status_goes_indexing_then_idle` now has a slow mock encode (`time.sleep(0.05)`) and increased sleep iterations (5→8) to reliably catch the "indexing" state transition. Re-enabled in CI (removed `--deselect`).
- **Lint fix** — E701 (multiple statements on one line colon) in `auto_index_on_startup` fixed.
- **`numpy` import removed from `test_tools.py`** — was unused after removing `TestSemanticSearch` class.
- **Test assertion updates** — 3 indexing tests updated for the new 6-file count (`.js` now included in sample_dir). 2 persistence tests fixed for `os.replace` mocking now triggering triple-failure guard.
- **Docs: all 7 tools documented** — `keyword_search`, `update_file_index`, `drop_index`, `read_file_content` were previously undocumented.
- **JS test fixes** — 4 `runtime.test.js` assertions updated to include `--stdio` in expected server args, matching the MCP stdio support added in cli.js.
- **`dequeue_batch` duplicate-handling bug** — first iteration used `frozenset(batch)` which deduplicated identical (priority, path) tuples. Fixed by switching to index-based `heapq.nsmallest` with a `(priority, original_index)` sort key. Batch ordering fix: `sorted(selected)` → `sorted(selected, key=_sort_key)` so items return in priority order, not raw index order.

### Known Issues

- First search/index call is ~5s (fastembed model load — unavoidable cold start of the ~30MB model)
- Index is shared across all indexed directories (no multi-project isolation)
- File-level chunking only (2000-char truncation, no semantic splitting)
- `test_resource_status` integration test is flaky due to auto-index-on-startup scanning the project's own files before the test queries status
